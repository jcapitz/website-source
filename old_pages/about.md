Title: About

<img style="float:right; padding-left:10px" src="|filename|/images/drchivins_small.png" />

I am a statistician and data analyst interested in computational methods for solving data driven problems. My interests extend to machine learning , network theory, and data science across a variety of disciplines. At the moment I am working, among other things, in my master's thesis at Cal State Long Beach in genomic data analysis for cancer research.
